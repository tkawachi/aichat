# Active Context

## Current work focus
- Setting up the basic command-line interface using Cobra.
- Implementing configuration management with Viper and dotenv.
- Defining the core command structure and flags.

## Recent changes
- Initialized memory bank files.
- Defined project scope and requirements in projectbrief.md.
- Outlined product context, system patterns, and tech context.

## Next steps
- Implement the main command structure using Cobra.
- Set up configuration loading from environment variables and potentially a config file.
- Define basic commands (e.g., `aichat generate`, `aichat translate`).

## Active decisions and considerations
- Decide on the initial set of commands and functionalities to implement.
- Choose the first LLM API to integrate with (likely OpenAI).
- Determine the configuration file format (if needed).
