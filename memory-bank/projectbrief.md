# Project Brief

## Project Goal
Develop a command-line tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance user productivity and task automation.

## Core Requirements
- Provide a user-friendly command-line interface.
- Integrate with one or more LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Google Cloud AI).
- Support various LLM functionalities such as text generation, code completion, and translation.
- Ensure secure handling of API keys and user data.
- Implement robust error handling and informative user feedback.

## Scope
This project focuses on building the core command-line tool and integrating basic LLM functionalities. Advanced features and extensive API integrations may be considered in future iterations.
